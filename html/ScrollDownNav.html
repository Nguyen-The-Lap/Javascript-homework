            Party affiliation of current United States state and territorial governors
            Governors in the United States are elected by each of the fifty states and five inhabited territories. The governor serves as the chief executive of the state or territorial government. The sole federal district, the District of Columbia, elects a mayor to oversee its government in a similar manner. As of 2024, there are twenty-seven states with Republican governors and twenty-three states with Democratic governors. For most states and territories, the current gubernatorial term ends and a new term begins in January, two months after the election; in Alaska, Hawaii, North Dakota and Kentucky, the term begins in December. Governors serve four-year terms in most states and all territories; New Hampshire and Vermont have two-year terms for their governors. Thirty-seven states and four territories also have term limits that generally allow a governor to serve two consecutive terms. All fifty-five governors are members of the National Governors Association, a non-partisan organization that represents states and territories in discussions with the federal government.

            The Abduction of Europa	
            The Abduction of Europa is a 1632 oil-on-panel painting by Rembrandt. One of his rare mythological works, it was inspired by Ovid's Metamorphoses, part of which tells the tale of Zeus's seduction and capture of Europa. The painting shows a coastal scene with Europa being carried away in rough waters by Zeus in the form of a bull while her friends remain on shore with expressions of horror. The use of an ancient myth to impart a contemporary thought and his portrayal of the scene using the High Baroque style are two strong aspects of the work. It was also influenced by Titian's painting of the same subject 70 years earlier, although there are significant differences; Rembrandt's painting is less violent in nature than Titian's. The Abduction of Europa is now in the collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum in New York City.

            Party affiliation of current United States state and territorial governors
            Governors in the United States are elected by each of the fifty states and five inhabited territories. The governor serves as the chief executive of the state or territorial government. The sole federal district, the District of Columbia, elects a mayor to oversee its government in a similar manner. As of 2024, there are twenty-seven states with Republican governors and twenty-three states with Democratic governors. For most states and territories, the current gubernatorial term ends and a new term begins in January, two months after the election; in Alaska, Hawaii, North Dakota and Kentucky, the term begins in December. Governors serve four-year terms in most states and all territories; New Hampshire and Vermont have two-year terms for their governors. Thirty-seven states and four territories also have term limits that generally allow a governor to serve two consecutive terms. All fifty-five governors are members of the National Governors Association, a non-partisan organization that represents states and territories in discussions with the federal government.

            The Abduction of Europa	
            The Abduction of Europa is a 1632 oil-on-panel painting by Rembrandt. One of his rare mythological works, it was inspired by Ovid's Metamorphoses, part of which tells the tale of Zeus's seduction and capture of Europa. The painting shows a coastal scene with Europa being carried away in rough waters by Zeus in the form of a bull while her friends remain on shore with expressions of horror. The use of an ancient myth to impart a contemporary thought and his portrayal of the scene using the High Baroque style are two strong aspects of the work. It was also influenced by Titian's painting of the same subject 70 years earlier, although there are significant differences; Rembrandt's painting is less violent in nature than Titian's. The Abduction of Europa is now in the collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum in New York City.
